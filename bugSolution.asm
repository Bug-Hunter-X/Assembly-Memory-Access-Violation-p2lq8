Before executing mov eax, [ebx + ecx*4 + 0x10]:

1. Check the bounds of ecx to ensure it doesn't lead to an address overflow. 
2. Verify that the calculated address (ebx + ecx*4 + 0x10) falls within the allocated memory space using comparison instructions.
3. If the address is invalid, use alternative code to handle this condition, prevent the error, and potentially display error messages.

Example (Illustrative -  specific implementation depends on context):

; Check if ecx is within a valid range (e.g., 0 to array_size -1)
mov eax, array_size ; Assuming array_size is defined elsewhere
sub eax, 1 ; Adjust range to 0-based index
cmp ecx, eax
jge invalid_address ; Jump if ecx is out of bounds

; Calculate the address
mov eax, ebx
add eax, ecx
lea eax, [eax*4 + 0x10] ; More efficient address calculation

; Check if the address falls within the valid memory range
cmp eax, memory_start ; memory_start and memory_end are defined elsewhere
jg invalid_address
cmp eax, memory_end
jle valid_address ; Proceed if within valid range

jmp invalid_address ; Jump to error handling

valid_address:
mov eax, [eax]
; ... continue with your code ...

invalid_address:
; ... handle the error, e.g. print an error message and exit gracefully ...
