# Assembly Memory Access Violation

This repository demonstrates a common error in assembly programming: accessing memory outside the allocated bounds. The error occurs in the `mov` instruction, where the calculated address falls outside the valid memory range.

## Bug Description

The `mov eax, [ebx + ecx*4 + 0x10]` instruction calculates a memory address based on the values in registers `ebx`, `ecx`, and a constant offset `0x10`. If the calculated address is invalid (e.g., it points to non-allocated memory or an unmapped region), a segmentation fault or other unexpected behavior will occur.

## Solution

The solution involves carefully checking the calculated memory address before accessing it. This typically involves range checks to ensure the address falls within allocated memory bounds.  Appropriate error handling is implemented to prevent crashes.
