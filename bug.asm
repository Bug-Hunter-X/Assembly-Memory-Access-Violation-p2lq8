mov eax, [ebx + ecx*4 + 0x10]

This instruction attempts to access memory at an address calculated as ebx + ecx*4 + 0x10.  The problem arises if the resulting address is outside the bounds of allocated memory or points to an invalid memory location.  This can lead to a segmentation fault or other unexpected behavior.
